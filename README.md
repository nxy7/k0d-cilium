# My findings
while trying to use k0s for development, I've found that it's really hard to make it work nicely inside containers. Single node setup was not working due to [this issue](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/20942) and multi node setup ended up not working out because of cgroups. As far as I understand each node needs to be a part of different cgroup namespace, but if I set `cgroup: private` inside compose it would not start at all.
Instead of using k0s I'm using kind until single node issue is resolved or setting up multi node cluster in docker becomes easier.

Spin up k0s cluster inside docker

### Prerequisites
- docker
- bash
- kubectl

And I strongly recommend
- nushell
as bash script might be lagging behind and be updated less frequently

```bash
  # with nushell
  ./k0d.nu
  # with bash
  ./k0d.sh
```
